K-Means clustering model is used on a customers dataset to perform clustering. The customers dataset contain 200 data of a shop customers that contain gender, age, annual income (k$) and spending score (1-100). Numpy and Pandas module are used to perform preprocessing on the datasets before train into the model. Elbow method are used to find th optimal number of clusters and the clusters can be seen on the graph plotted.
